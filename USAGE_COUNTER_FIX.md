# 🔄 Usage Counter Real-Time Update Fix

## **PROBLEM**

The AI generations counter (usage badge) was only updating after **page refresh**, not immediately after analysis completed.

### **User Experience Issue**

1. User completes analysis → sees "10 companies loaded" ✅
2. Usage counter still shows "0 out of 10" ❌ (stale)
3. User refreshes page → counter updates to "3 out of 10" ✅

**Expected:** Counter should update immediately after analysis completes, without requiring a page refresh.

---

## **ROOT CAUSE**

In `src/app/page.tsx`, the `handleConfirmICP` function (main analysis flow):
- ✅ Saves prospects to database
- ✅ Shows success toast
- ❌ **Never calls `loadUsageData()` to refresh the usage counter**

The `loadUsageData()` function was only called:
1. On page mount (`useEffect`)
2. After "Generate More" completes (via `onUsageUpdate` prop in `MarketMapPanel`)

But **NOT** after the initial analysis in `handleConfirmICP`.

---

## **THE FIX**

### **Added Usage Refresh in Two Places**

#### **1. After Successful Analysis**

```typescript
// In handleConfirmICP function
// Show success message
toast.success(`Analysis complete! Found ${finalResult.prospects?.length || 0} prospects.`);

// ✅ Refresh usage counter immediately after successful analysis
await loadUsageData();
```

#### **2. After 402 Limit Error**

```typescript
// In handleConfirmICP function - 402 handler
toast.error(errorData.error || 'You have reached your AI generation limit', {
  duration: 10000,
  action: {
    label: `Upgrade to ${planName}`,
    onClick: () => {
      window.location.href = '/settings/billing';
    },
  },
});

// ✅ Refresh usage counter to show updated limit state
await loadUsageData();
return;
```

---

## **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Usage Update Flow (Before Fix)**

```
1. User clicks "Looks good - continue"
2. Analysis runs → calls /api/analyse
3. API increments usage counter in database ✅
4. Frontend receives results and shows prospects ✅
5. Usage badge NOT updated ❌
6. User refreshes page
7. useEffect() runs → loadUsageData() → badge updates ✅
```

### **Usage Update Flow (After Fix)**

```
1. User clicks "Looks good - continue"
2. Analysis runs → calls /api/analyse
3. API increments usage counter in database ✅
4. Frontend receives results and shows prospects ✅
5. loadUsageData() called immediately ✅
6. Usage badge updates in real-time ✅
7. User sees "3 out of 10" without refresh ✅
```

## **CONSISTENCY ACROSS APP**

Now all AI generation flows update usage immediately:

| Flow | Updates Usage Counter? |
|------|------------------------|
| Initial Analysis (`handleConfirmICP`) | ✅ YES (newly fixed) |
| Generate More (`MarketMapPanel`) | ✅ YES (already working) |
| Manual Prospect Analysis (`ProspectsTab`) | ✅ YES (via `onProspectUpdate` → refetch) |
| 402 Limit Error | ✅ YES (newly fixed) |

---

## **TESTING**

### **Test Real-Time Update**

1. **Clear your usage** (for clean test):
```bash
cd /Users/ionutfurnea/gtm-map
node scripts/restore-trial.mjs ionutfurnea@gmail.com
```

2. **Run analysis:**
   - Reload app
   - Enter website: `imfuna.com`
   - Upload customers CSV
   - Extract ICP
   - **Before clicking "Looks good":** Note the usage counter (should be "0/10")
   - Click "Looks good - continue to find prospects"
   - Wait for analysis to complete
   - **After analysis:** ✅ Usage counter should immediately show "1/10" **without refreshing**

3. **Verify the count is correct:**
   - Check database:
```sql
SELECT generations_used, max_generations 
FROM user_trials 
WHERE user_id = '888db108-cca4-4f1d-8c37-5f552ffb61f1';
```
   - Should match what's displayed in UI ✅

---

## **BENEFITS**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Stale usage counter | ✅ Real-time updates |
| ❌ Requires page refresh to see changes | ✅ Immediate feedback |
| ❌ Confusing UX (user thinks generation didn't count) | ✅ Clear, transparent UX |
| ❌ Inconsistent behavior across features | ✅ Consistent real-time updates |

---

## **FILES CHANGED**

**`/Users/ionutfurnea/gtm-map/src/app/page.tsx`**
- Added `await loadUsageData();` after successful analysis completion
- Added `await loadUsageData();` after 402 limit error handling

---

## **STATUS**
✅ **FIXED** - Ready to test!

The usage counter will now update in real-time immediately after:
1. ✅ Initial analysis completes
2. ✅ Generate More completes
3. ✅ User hits their limit (402 error)

No more page refreshes needed to see accurate usage counts! 🎉
