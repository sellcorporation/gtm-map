# ✅ AUTOMATIC DOMAIN CORRECTION - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: When competitor discovery returns wrong domains (e.g., `valunation.co.uk` instead of `valunation.com`):
- Website fetch fails → timeout
- System falls back to simple scoring
- Result: ICP Score = 9 (wrong!)
- Confidence = 90% (misleading!)

**Root Cause**: AI didn't verify or search for correct domain when initial fetch failed.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **Automatic Web Search for Correct Domains**

When a domain fails to load, the system now:

1. **Searches the Web** using multiple strategies:
   ```
   Search 1: "[Company Name] official website"
   Search 2: "[Company Name] company website"
   Search 3: "[Company Name] home page"
   ```

2. **Filters Out Aggregators**:
   - ❌ LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram
   - ❌ Clutch, Yelp, Trustpilot
   - ❌ Wikipedia, Crunchbase
   - ❌ Directory/listing sites
   - ✅ Only actual company websites

3. **Validates Domain**:
   - Must be ≥5 characters
   - Must contain a TLD (`.com`, `.co.uk`, etc.)
   - Must be different from original domain
   - Must actually respond to HTTP requests

4. **Retries Analysis**:
   - Fetches content from corrected domain
   - Runs AI workflow analysis
   - Saves accurate ICP score + correct domain

5. **Fallback Only as Last Resort**:
   - If web search fails → use fallback scoring
   - But this is now rare!

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Step-by-Step Flow**:

   ↓ FAIL (timeout)
   
2. Detect fetch failure
   ↓
   
3. Search web with multiple queries:
   - "Valunation official website"
   - "Valunation company website"  
   - "Valunation home page"
   ↓
   
4. Filter results:
   - Skip LinkedIn (aggregator)
   - Skip Yelp (directory)
   - Keep valunation.com ✅
   ↓
   
5. Validate domain:
   - Length ≥ 5? ✅
   - Has TLD? ✅
   - Different from original? ✅
   ↓
   
6. Retry with corrected domain:
   - Fetch valunation.com ✅
   - AI analysis ✅
   - ICP Score 90 ✅
   ↓
   
7. Save to database:
   - Domain: valunation.com (corrected)
   - ICP: 90/100
   - Confidence: 85%
   - Evidence: Real data from website
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **To Verify It Works**:

1. **Clear All Data** (button in UI)
2. **Run New Analysis** with your CSV
3. **Watch Progress Panel** for:
   - Domain fetch failures
   - Web search messages
   - Domain corrections
   - "domain corrected" suffix on success

### **Expected Behavior**:

**For Valunation**:
```
Before: valunation.co.uk → ICP 9
After:  valunation.com → ICP 85-90
```

**For Any Failed Domain**:
- System searches web automatically
- Finds correct domain
- Retries analysis
- Saves accurate score

### **Fallback Only If**:
- Web search finds nothing
- Corrected domain also fails
- No Tavily API key (unlikely)
