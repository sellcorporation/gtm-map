## üó∫Ô∏è Market Mapping (Visual Competitive Matrix)

**Status**: Archived  
**Date Archived**: October 14, 2025  
**Branch**: `feature/market-mapping` (preserved in remote)  
**Tag**: `archive/market-mapping-v1`  
**Spec Document**: `MARKET_MAPPING_FEATURE_SPEC.md` (in branch)  

### What It Is
A visual 2D matrix where users can drag-and-drop companies to position them based on custom metrics (e.g., Traffic Share vs. Conversion Rate, Price vs. Features). Similar to BCG Matrix or Gartner Magic Quadrant, but customizable and interactive.

### Why Archived
**Decision**: Not a priority for early-stage target audience

**Reasoning**:
- Early-stage founders typically have 0-10 prospects, not enough for meaningful visualization
- Manual drag-and-drop positioning creates friction for time-starved users
- The problem we're solving is "I need leads" (acquisition), not "I need to visualize leads" (analysis)
- 5-7 days of dev time better spent on action-oriented features
- Visual mapping is valuable at 50+ companies, but most users won't reach that threshold early

**Higher Priority Alternatives**:
1. ‚úÖ Email template generation (immediate action ‚Üí closing deals)
2. ‚úÖ Smart prospect prioritization (AI scoring ‚Üí saves time)
3. ‚úÖ LinkedIn integration (bridges to where founders work)
4. ‚úÖ CRM integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce)
5. ‚úÖ Better filtering & search (quick wins with existing data)

### When to Revisit
**Criteria for Re-prioritization**:
- [ ] Product has reached product-market fit
- [ ] Average user has 50+ prospects in system
- [ ] Users explicitly requesting visualization features
- [ ] Positioned as premium/Pro-only differentiator
- [ ] Can be built with AI auto-positioning (not manual drag-drop)

**Estimated Effort**: 5-7 days for MVP (canvas, drag-drop, save positions)  
**Future Enhancement**: Make it AI-powered (auto-position based on scraped data)

### How to Restore
If you decide to build this feature:

```bash
# Checkout the archived branch
git checkout -b feature/market-mapping origin/feature/market-mapping

# Or restore from tag
git checkout -b feature/market-mapping archive/market-mapping-v1

# Review the spec
open MARKET_MAPPING_FEATURE_SPEC.md

# Run the migration
psql -f migrations/market_mapping_feature.sql
```

**Documentation**:
- Full specification: See `MARKET_MAPPING_FEATURE_SPEC.md` in branch
- Database migration: `migrations/market_mapping_feature.sql`
- 3 new tables: `market_maps`, `market_map_positions`, `market_map_shares`
- 8 API endpoints defined
- Component architecture specified

## üìã How to Archive a Feature

For future reference, here's the process used:

1. **Complete the specification** (design, database, API, components)
2. **Commit all work** to a feature branch
3. **Push branch to remote** (`git push origin feature/name`)
4. **Create archive tag** (`git tag -a archive/feature-name-v1 -m "Archive reason"`)
5. **Push tag** (`git push origin archive/feature-name-v1`)
6. **Switch to main** (`git checkout main`)
7. **Delete local branch** (`git branch -D feature/name`)
8. **Document in this file** (what, why, when to revisit)

The branch and tag remain in the remote repository for future reference.
