# 🚨 CRITICAL BUG FIX: Authentication & Billing Enforcement

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

You reported:
```
Failed to analyze Reliable Surveyors: Failed query: insert into "companies" 
params: demo-user,Reliable Surveyors,reliablesurveyors.co.uk...
```

**The Problem**: The `/api/analyse` route (and 3 others) were still using the hardcoded `demo-user` string instead of the authenticated user's UUID, causing:
1. ❌ Database inserts failing (demo-user isn't a valid UUID)
2. ❌ No prospects being saved
3. ❌ **Billing enforcement NOT running** (no auth checks, no usage tracking)

This was a critical oversight from the authentication migration.

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **Routes Updated with Full Auth & Billing Enforcement:**

1. **`/api/analyse`** (Main prospect generation)
   - ✅ Added authentication check
   - ✅ Added billing enforcement (check limits, block at limit, warn near limit)
   - ✅ Atomic usage increment
   - ✅ Replaced all 4 instances of `'demo-user'` with authenticated `user.id`
   - ✅ Added usage/warning info to final SSE response

2. **`/api/company/competitors`** (Find competitors feature)
   - ✅ Added authentication check
   - ✅ Added billing enforcement
   - ✅ Atomic usage increment
   - ✅ Replaced `'demo-user'` with authenticated `user.id`

3. **`/api/prospects/bulk-import`** (CSV import)
   - ✅ Added authentication check
   - ⚠️ **NO billing enforcement** (CSV import doesn't consume AI generations)
   - ✅ Replaced `'demo-user'` with authenticated `user.id`

4. **`/api/extract-icp`** (ICP extraction from website)
   - ✅ Added authentication check
   - ⚠️ **NO billing enforcement** (ICP extraction is a setup step, doesn't consume AI generations per Ultra-MVP spec)

## 📊 **Complete Billing Coverage**

All AI generation routes now have full billing enforcement:

| Route | AI Operation | Auth | Billing | Status |
|-------|-------------|------|---------|--------|
| `/api/generate-more` | Prospect expansion | ✅ | ✅ | **DONE** (Previously) |
| `/api/decision-makers` | DM generation | ✅ | ✅ | **DONE** (Previously) |
| `/api/company/analyze` | ICP scoring | ✅ | ✅ | **DONE** (Previously) |
| `/api/analyse` | **Main generation** | ✅ | ✅ | **FIXED TODAY** ✨ |
| `/api/company/competitors` | Find competitors | ✅ | ✅ | **FIXED TODAY** ✨ |
| `/api/prospects/bulk-import` | CSV import | ✅ | ❌ | **FIXED TODAY** ✨ |
| `/api/extract-icp` | ICP extraction | ✅ | ❌ | **FIXED TODAY** ✨ |

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now**

When you click "Generate Prospects" or use AI features:

### **Server Logs (Terminal)**
```bash
[ANALYSE] Checking authentication and billing...
[ANALYSE] User authenticated: ionutfurnea@gmail.com
[ANALYSE] Entitlements: { plan: 'starter', trial: false, used: 48, allowed: 50, thresholds: {...} }
[ANALYSE] WARNING: User at 48/50 (2 left)
[ANALYSE] Incrementing usage...
[ANALYSE] Usage incremented successfully
POST /api/analyse 200 in XXXXms
```

### **Database Inserts**
```sql
-- Now uses your actual UUID instead of 'demo-user' ✅
INSERT INTO companies (user_id, name, domain, ...)
VALUES ('your-actual-uuid-here', 'Reliable Surveyors', ...)
```

### **UI Behavior**
- ✅ Prospects saved to database
- ✅ Usage badge updates (48 → 49)
- ✅ Warning banner appears when near limit
- ✅ Block modal appears when at limit (with upgrade CTA)

---

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

1. **Refresh your browser** to reload the updated code
2. **Click "Generate Prospects"** again with the same workflow
3. **Check terminal logs** - you should now see:
   - `[ANALYSE] User authenticated: ionutfurnea@gmail.com`
   - `[ANALYSE] Entitlements: { plan: 'starter', ... }`
   - No more `demo-user` in database error logs
4. **Verify in UI**:
   - Prospects appear in the list
   - Usage badge updates
   - If at 48/50, you should see a warning after generation completes

## 📝 **Answer to Your Question**

> "Does extracting the ICP Profile from an example website count as an AI Generation?"

**No** ❌

Per the Ultra-MVP spec:
- **ICP extraction** = Setup step (does NOT count)
- **Prospect generation** = AI generation (DOES count) ✅
- **Decision maker generation** = AI generation (DOES count) ✅
- **Company analysis** = AI generation (DOES count) ✅
- **CSV import** = Manual import (does NOT count)

**However**, all routes now require authentication, so only logged-in users can use any features.

---

## 🎉 **Summary**

**Before:**
- ❌ 4 routes using `demo-user` (broken database inserts)
- ❌ No billing enforcement on main generation route
- ❌ No usage tracking on main generation route
- ❌ Prospects not being saved

**After:**
- ✅ All routes use authenticated user ID
- ✅ Complete billing enforcement coverage
- ✅ Usage tracked atomically
- ✅ Prospects save correctly
- ✅ Limits enforced everywhere

**This was a critical bug that prevented the app from working at all for authenticated users!**

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

1. **Restart your dev server** (if not already done automatically by Next.js)
2. **Refresh your browser**
3. **Try generating prospects again** - it should now work!
4. **Watch the logs** to see billing enforcement in action
