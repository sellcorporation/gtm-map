# Edge Cases & Security Testing - GTM Map Authentication

## Overview

This document covers uncommon scenarios, error conditions, and security vulnerabilities to test.

---

## 1. Authentication Edge Cases üîê

### 1.1 Token Manipulation

**Test**: Modified JWT Token
```bash
# Steps:
1. Log in successfully
2. Open DevTools > Application > Cookies
3. Find Supabase auth cookie
4. Modify the token value (change 1 character)
5. Refresh page

# Expected:
- Middleware rejects invalid token
- Redirect to /login
- Error logged (but not shown to user)
```

**Test**: Expired Access Token
```bash
# Steps:
1. Log in
2. Wait for access token to expire (default: 1 hour)
3. Perform action (e.g., create company)

# Expected:
- Supabase automatically refreshes token using refresh token
- Action succeeds without user noticing
- New access token in cookies
```

**Test**: Missing Refresh Token
```bash
# Steps:
1. Log in
2. Delete refresh token cookie manually
3. Wait for access token to expire
4. Try to access protected route

# Expected:
- Cannot refresh session
- Redirect to /login
- User must re-authenticate
```

### 1.2 Session Edge Cases

**Test**: Concurrent Logins (Same User, Different Locations)
```bash
# Scenario: User logs in from home, then from office
# Expected: Both sessions active (multi-device support)

# Steps:
1. Login from Browser A (Chrome, Location: Home)
2. Login from Browser B (Firefox, Location: Office)
3. Verify both sessions active
4. Logout from Browser A
5. Verify Browser B session still active
```

**Test**: Zombie Session (Orphaned Browser Tab)
```bash
# Scenario: User closes laptop for 3 days, then reopens

# Steps:
1. Login on laptop
2. Close laptop (sleep mode) for 7+ days
3. Wake laptop, app tab still open
4. Try to perform action

# Expected:
- Session expired (7-day TTL)
- Middleware catches expired session
- Redirect to /login
```

**Test**: Session Fixation Attack
```bash
# Scenario: Attacker tries to use a pre-set session ID

# Steps:
1. Attacker creates a session ID
2. Tricks victim into using that session
3. Attacker tries to access victim's session

# Expected:
- Supabase Auth prevents session fixation
- Each login creates a new session token
- Old tokens invalidated
```

---

### 1.3 Email Verification Edge Cases

**Test**: Click Verification Link Twice
```bash
# Steps:
1. Sign up (receive verification email)
2. Click verification link ‚Üí redirected to app
3. Click same link again (from email)

# Expected:
- First click: Verify succeeds, redirect to app
- Second click: Already verified, redirect to app (no error)
```

**Test**: Verification Link After 24 Hours
```bash
# Steps:
1. Sign up
2. Wait 24+ hours (without verifying)
3. Click verification link

# Expected:
- Link expired
- Show error: "Verification link expired"
- Provide "Resend verification email" button
```

**Test**: Sign Up with Already-Verified Email
```bash
# Steps:
1. User A signs up with alice@test.com, verifies
2. User A tries to sign up again with same email

# Expected:
- Error: "User already registered"
- No duplicate entry in auth.users
```

---

### 1.4 Password Edge Cases

**Test**: Very Long Password (100+ chars)
```bash
# Steps:
1. Sign up with password: (100 characters)
2. Complete signup
3. Login with same 100-char password

# Expected:
- Signup succeeds (or fails gracefully if limit exists)
- Login works with full password
```

**Test**: Password with Unicode/Emoji
```bash
# Steps:
1. Sign up with password: "P–∞ssword123!üòÄ" (Cyrillic '–∞', emoji)
2. Login with same password

# Expected:
- Supabase handles Unicode correctly
- Login succeeds
```

**Test**: Password Reset for Non-Existent Email
```bash
# Steps:
1. Go to /forgot-password
2. Enter email: nonexistent@test.com
3. Submit

# Expected:
- Generic success message ("Check your email")
- No email sent (security: don't leak user existence)
```

**Test**: Multiple Password Reset Requests (Rate Limiting)
```bash
# Steps:
1. Request password reset 10 times in 1 minute

# Expected:
- Supabase rate limits (e.g., 3 requests/hour)
- Later requests return 429 Too Many Requests
```

## 2. Security Vulnerabilities üõ°Ô∏è

### 2.1 SQL Injection

**Test**: Login Form SQL Injection
```bash
# Attack Vector: Email field
Input: admin' OR '1'='1' --
Password: anything

# Expected:
- Login fails
- Supabase parameterizes queries (immune to SQL injection)
- No SQL error exposed to user
```

Input: John'; DROP TABLE companies; --

# Expected:
- Name stored as literal string
- No SQL executed
- No tables dropped
```

---

### 2.2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Test**: Reflected XSS in URL
```bash
# Attack: Inject script in URL parameter
URL: /login?message=<script>alert('XSS')</script>

# Expected:
- Message parameter sanitized before rendering
- No script execution
- Show error or ignore malicious input
```

**Test**: Stored XSS in User Data
```bash

- Or blocked by CORS policy
- No company created
```

**Test**: CSRF on Password Change
```bash
# Attack: Malicious site triggers password reset
Steps:
1. User logs in
2. Visits malicious site
3. Site sends: POST /api/auth/reset-password

# Expected:
- Supabase requires confirmation token
- Cannot change password via CSRF
```

---

### 2.4 Broken Access Control

**Test**: Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
```bash
# Attack: User A tries to access User B's company
Steps:
1. User A logs in, gets company ID: 123
2. User B logs in, gets company ID: 456
3. User A sends: GET /api/company?id=456

# Expected:
- RLS blocks access
- Returns 0 rows or 403 Forbidden
- User A cannot see User B's data
```

**Test**: Privilege Escalation (Change User ID)
```bash
# Attack: User A tries to insert data for User B
Steps:
1. User A logs in
2. User A sends: POST /api/company {user_id: "USER_B_UUID", name: "Fake Co"}

# Expected:
