# ✅ Subscription Upgrade Fix - COMPLETE

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Branch**: `settings-and-billing`  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented and Ready to Test

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before**: When a user with an existing subscription (e.g., Starter) clicked "Upgrade to Pro", the system would create a **SECOND subscription** instead of updating the existing one. This caused:
- Users to be charged for BOTH plans (£29 + £99 = £128/month)
- Database confusion about which subscription was active
- No proper proration (immediate credit for unused time)

**After**: The system now correctly:
1. **Detects existing subscriptions** and updates them with proration
2. **Charges prorated amount immediately** (e.g., ~£78 instead of full £99)
3. **Updates limits immediately** (50 → 200 generations)
4. **Preserves usage** (if at 50/50, becomes 50/200 after upgrade)
5. **Keeps billing date unchanged** (monthly anniversary stays the same)

## 📝 What Was Changed

### 1. **Backend: `/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`**

**Added Logic**:
- Checks for existing `stripe_subscription_id` in database
- If subscription exists → **Update path** (proration)
- If no subscription → **Checkout path** (new subscription)

**Update Path** (lines 172-240):
```typescript
if (sub?.stripe_subscription_id) {
  // Retrieve subscription from Stripe
  const stripeSubscription = await stripe.subscriptions.retrieve(
    sub.stripe_subscription_id
  );
  
  // Update with proration
  const updatedSubscription = await stripe.subscriptions.update(
    sub.stripe_subscription_id,
    {
      items: [{
        id: stripeSubscription.items.data[0].id,
        price: priceData.stripe_price_id,
      }],
      proration_behavior: 'always_invoice', // ✅ Immediate charge
      billing_cycle_anchor: 'unchanged',    // ✅ Keep billing date
    }
  );
  
  // Update database immediately
  await supabaseAdmin
    .from('user_subscriptions')
    .update({ plan_id: plan })
    .eq('user_id', user.id);
  
  // Return success (no Stripe Checkout needed)
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    url: `/settings/billing?upgraded=true&plan=${plan}`,
    upgraded: true,
    plan: plan,
    message: `Successfully upgraded to ${plan}!`
  });
}
```

**Extensive Logging**:
- Added `[CHECKOUT] ========== UPGRADE PATH ==========` logs
- Logs current plan, requested plan, proration behavior
- Logs database update success/failure

### 2. **Frontend: `page.tsx` - `handleUpgrade` Function**

**Before** (line 636):
```typescript
const handleUpgrade = async (plan: 'starter' | 'pro') => {
  window.location.href = '/settings/billing'; // ❌ Just redirected
};
```

**After** (lines 636-676):
```typescript
const handleUpgrade = async (plan: 'starter' | 'pro') => {
  // Call checkout API
  const response = await fetch('/api/stripe/checkout', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ plan }),
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  if (data.upgraded) {
    // ✅ Direct upgrade (existing subscription updated)
    toast.success(data.message);
    await loadUsageData(); // Refresh limits
    window.location.href = data.url;
  } else if (data.url) {
    // ✅ New subscription (redirect to Stripe Checkout)
    window.location.href = data.url;
  }
};
```

### 3. **Frontend: Billing Page - Success Message**

**Added** (lines 22-37):
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const upgraded = searchParams.get('upgraded');
  const plan = searchParams.get('plan');
  
  if (upgraded === 'true' && plan) {
    toast.success(`🎉 Successfully upgraded to ${plan}!`, {
      duration: 5000,
    });
    
    // Clean up URL
    window.history.replaceState({}, '', '/settings/billing');
  }
  
  loadBillingData();
}, []);
```

**Imported**:
- `useSearchParams` from `next/navigation`
- `toast` from `react-hot-toast`

## 💰 How Proration Works

### Example: Starter → Pro Upgrade After 1 Week

**Initial Subscription**:
- Plan: Starter (£29/month)
- Billing date: 1st of each month
- Usage: 50/50 AI generations

**Day 7 - User Clicks "Upgrade to Pro"**:

**What Stripe Does**:
1. Calculates unused Starter time: 23 days remaining (23/30 of month)
2. Credit for unused time: £29 × (23/30) = ~£22.23
3. Full Pro monthly cost: £99
4. **Prorated charge TODAY**: £99 - £22.23 = **£76.77**

**What User Gets Immediately**:
- ✅ New limit: 200 AI generations/month
- ✅ Current usage: 50/200 (not reset!)
- ✅ Can generate 150 more this month
- ✅ Billing date unchanged: Still 1st of month

**Next Month (Day 30)**:
- Usage resets: 0/200
- Full charge: £99 (no proration)
- Billed on 1st of next month (original date)

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Test 1: Trial → Starter (New Subscription)
**User**: No existing subscription  
**Action**: Click "Upgrade to Starter" in BlockModal  
**Expected**:
- Redirected to Stripe Checkout
- Creates NEW subscription via Checkout
- Webhook processes `checkout.session.completed`
- User subscriptions table updated
- Returns to billing page with success message

### ✅ Test 2: Starter → Pro (Upgrade with Proration)
**User**: Has active Starter subscription  
**Action**: Click "Upgrade to Pro" in BlockModal  
**Expected**:
- **No Stripe Checkout redirect**
- Subscription updated immediately
- Prorated charge (~£70-80 depending on timing)
- Database updated immediately
- Redirected to billing page with success toast
- Usage limit updates: 50 → 200
- Usage count preserved: 50/50 → 50/200
- Can immediately generate more prospects

### ✅ Test 3: Multiple Upgrade Attempts
**User**: Starter user clicks "Upgrade to Pro" twice quickly  
**Expected**:
- First request: Updates subscription
- Second request: Either:
  - Detects already on Pro → Shows message
  - OR Stripe rejects duplicate update

### ✅ Test 4: Upgrade During Trial
**User**: Trial user (no paid subscription)  
**Action**: Click "Upgrade to Starter"  
**Expected**:
- Goes through Checkout (new subscription)
- Trial closed in database
- Subscription created
- Usage counter switches from trial to monthly

## 📊 Billing Behavior Matrix

| Current Plan | Upgrade To | Behavior | Immediate Charge | Usage Reset |
|--------------|-----------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Trial (no sub) | Starter | Checkout | £29 | ✅ Resets to 0/50 |
| Trial (no sub) | Pro | Checkout | £99 | ✅ Resets to 0/200 |
| Starter | Pro | Update | ~£70-80 (prorated) | ❌ Stays (e.g., 50/200) |
| Pro | Starter | Update* | Credit applied to next invoice | ❌ Stays (but limit reduced) |
| Free | Starter | Checkout | £29 | ✅ Resets to 0/50 |
| Free | Pro | Checkout | £99 | ✅ Resets to 0/200 |

**Downgrade Note**: Pro → Starter should be scheduled for period end (not implemented yet, need to add `proration_behavior: 'none'` and `cancel_at_period_end: false`)

## 🔍 How to Verify It Works

### In Server Logs (`npm run dev` terminal):

**For Upgrade (Existing Subscription)**:
```
[CHECKOUT] ========== UPGRADE PATH (Existing Subscription) ==========
[CHECKOUT] Upgrading from: starter → pro
[CHECKOUT] Current Stripe subscription status: active
[CHECKOUT] Updating subscription with proration...
[CHECKOUT] ✓ Subscription updated: sub_abc123
[CHECKOUT] Proration behavior: always_invoice (immediate charge)
[CHECKOUT] Billing cycle anchor: unchanged
[CHECKOUT] ✓ Database updated
[CHECKOUT] ========== UPGRADE SUCCESS ==========
```

**For New Subscription**:
```
[CHECKOUT] ========== NEW SUBSCRIPTION PATH ==========
[CHECKOUT] No existing subscription, creating checkout session...
[CHECKOUT] ✓ Session created: cs_test_abc123
[CHECKOUT] ✓ Checkout URL: https://checkout.stripe.com/...
```

### In Stripe Dashboard:

1. Go to **Customers** → Find your test user
2. Check **Subscriptions** tab
3. Verify **only ONE active subscription** exists
4. Click on subscription → View **Updates**
5. Look for "Plan changed" event with proration invoice

### In Database:

```sql
-- Check subscriptions (should only have ONE per user)
SELECT user_id, plan_id, stripe_subscription_id, status 
FROM user_subscriptions 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';

-- Check usage limits
SELECT id, max_ai_generations_per_month 
FROM subscription_plans 
WHERE id IN ('starter', 'pro');
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Usage Does NOT Reset on Upgrade

**This is by design and prevents abuse**:
- User can't upgrade → use full limit → downgrade → repeat
- Billing period remains unchanged
- Only the **limit** changes, not the period

**Example**:
- User at 50/50 on Starter (blocked)
- Upgrades to Pro
- Now at 50/200 (can generate 150 more)
- On next billing date → Resets to 0/200

### Proration Amount Varies by Timing

The prorated charge depends on when the upgrade happens:
- **Day 1 of month**: Pay ~£99 (almost full month)
- **Day 7 of month**: Pay ~£77 (credit for 23 unused days)
- **Day 15 of month**: Pay ~£50 (credit for 15 unused days)
- **Day 29 of month**: Pay ~£3 (credit for 29 unused days)

### Stripe Invoices

Upgrades create **two** line items on the invoice:
1. **Credit**: -£X for unused time on old plan
2. **Charge**: +£Y for new plan (prorated period)
3. **Total**: Immediate charge (auto-paid)
